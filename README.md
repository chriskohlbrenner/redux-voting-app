A Redux app following tutorial here: http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html

Practice using Redux and React to implement an unelaborate implementation of a voting app. Given an array of strings (in the gifs below, names of countries), vote, see results, and narrow the original array down to a single winner.

### Basic interaction:
